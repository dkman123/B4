BigBrotherBot (B4) packaging documentation
==========================================

B4 is distributed as different packages:

   NOTE: these are old and not updated
  - Python sources package as a zip file
  - Python wheel package
  - Win32 zip package
  - Win32 installer package (built with InnoSetup Installer)

# Bumping the version number

You need the bumpversion tool for that task. See https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bumpversion/

Usage:

    bumpversion patch # will change "1.10.0" to "1.10.1"
    bumpversion minor # will change "1.10.0" to "1.11.0" 
    bumpversion major # will change "1.10.0" to "2.0.0"


# Packaging B4

To be able to build B4 distribution packages you need to have installed Python 2.7 32bit on your system.
You can check your python version by starting the python interpreter in a terminal window (or command 
prompt on win32 platform). Also you need to make sure to have `python` in your PATH environment variable.  
You also need to have installed [GIT](http://git-scm.com/) on your system and make sure that the `git` command
is in your PATH environment. Once the building process is completed you will find the built package(s) inside the 
*dist* directory.

    - `git clone https://github.com/BigBrotherBot/big-brother-bot.git`
