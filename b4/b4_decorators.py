    Cache the return value of a method

    This class is meant to be used as a decorator of methods. The return value
    from a given method invocation will be cached on the instance whose method
    was invoked. All arguments passed to a method decorated with memoize must
    be hashable.

    If a memoized method is invoked directly on its class the result will not
    be cached. Instead the method will be invoked like a static method:
    class Obj(object):
        @memoize

            return self + arg
    Obj.add_to(1) # not enough arguments
    Obj.add_to(1, 2) # returns 3, result is not cached

class GameEventRouter(object):
    """
    This module helps define handler functions to be called when a game event is received by providing :
      - a decorator for associating a regular expression to a handling function: @ger.gameEvent(<regular expression>,...)
      - a method getHandler(<text>) that return a tuple <func, dict> where *func* is the first handler function defined
        with the gameEvent decorator that matches the given *text* and *dict* is a dict of all matched groups from the
        regular expression that was associated to *func* with the decorator.

    USAGE :
    -------
    This tool is meant to be used by B3 game parsers which need to parse game event (in the form
    of a string) and call a function that takes action for this type of game event.
    
    To make a B3 parser take advantage of the GameEventRouter, the B3 parser needs to redefine
    the *parseLine* method as follow :
    
    >>> from b4_decorators import GameEventRouter
    >>>
    >>> ger = GameEventRouter()
    >>>
    >>> def parseLine(self, line):
    >>>     if line is None:
    >>>         return
    >>>     hfunc, param_dict = ger.getHandler(line)
    >>>     if hfunc:
    >>>         self.verbose2("calling %s%r" % (hfunc.func_name, param_dict))
    >>>         event = hfunc(self, **param_dict)
    >>>         if event:
    >>>             self.queueEvent(event)

    Let say you need to print "Robin joined team BLUE" when parsing a game event which is
    "join: Robin, BLUE" then you would have the following method in your B3 game parser:
    
    >>> @ger.gameEvent("^join: (?P<name>.+), (?P<team>.+)$")
    >>> def on_connect(self, name, team):
    >>>     print "%s joined team %s" % (name, team)
    
    Note that the handler function must have parameters that matches the regular expression groups.
    The @ger.gameEvent decorator accepts multiple parameters if you need to have one handling function for
    multiple kind of game events. Note that those regular expressions should all define the same groups.

class Singleton(object):
    """
    A non-thread-safe helper class to ease implementing singletons.
    This should be used as a decorator -- not a metaclass -- to the class that should be a singleton.

    The decorated class can define one `__init__` function that takes only the `self` argument.
    Other than that, there are no restrictions that apply to the decorated class.

    To get the singleton instance, use the `Instance` method. Trying to use `__call__` will result
    in a `b4_exceptions.ProgrammingError` being raised.

    Limitations: The decorated class cannot be inherited from.
