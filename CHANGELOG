# Plugin related changes:
- The !help command does not make B3 unresponsive anymore on Quake3 based games
- Xlrstats plugin: fixes issue with command !xlrstats command silently failing on a 1st time seen map https://github.com/xlr8or/big-brother-bot/issues/88
- Admin plugin: new command !unreg <player> which removes a player from the 'regular' group. Work together with the existing !makereg <player> command
- Admin plugin: new command !lastbans which lists the 5 last active bans/tempbans
- Admin plugin: new command !regulars which lists online players from the 'Regular' group
- Adv plugin: add new message keyword '@regulars' that will run the Admin plugin command !regulars
- Spamcontrol plugin : you can define the minimum group required to use the !spamins command. Also you can now define an alias for the spamins command.
- In plugin config files, you can use group keywords (user, reg, mod, admin, fulladmin, senioradmin, superadmin) instead of group levels when defining commands' required level

- Many minor bugfixes and improvements to B3 core and native plugins

# New games supported:

Urban Terror 4.2
 - UrT 4.2 has now its own B3 parser : iourt42
 - New penalty available : kill. You can use it in the censor plugin configuration for instance.
 - The Spamcontrol plugin reacts to radio message spamming
 - Fires game specific events for plugins : EVT_CLIENT_RADIO, EVT_CLIENT_CALLVOTE, EVT_CLIENT_VOTE, EVT_GAME_FLAG_HOTPOTATO for other plugins to act on.
 - There are new settings in the b3.xml config file to let you choose if you want to ban using the Frozen Sand auth system (with the rcon 'auth-ban' command). Have a look at the b3.iourt42.tpl template config file

# Upgrading note:

* Now B3 ensures group levels do exists when used in plugin config files. The plugin_admin.xml config files was using bad group level prior to B3 1.9.
  Make sure to correct them by comparing your own plugin_admin.xml with the new one.
* SpamControl plugin : The config file plugin_spamcontrol.xml has a new section regarding the !spamins command. Make sure to update your config file.
* FTP : if your b3.xml is set up to read your game server log file over ftp, then you may have to adjust the game_log value if you see that it isn't working good anymore. The correct url to
  set for game_log is the url that works in your Internet Browser.

1.1.3
-----
- Added COD4 parser
    - COD4 parser uses GUID instead of CID from the log files
    - COD4 parser uses GUID in log files as PBID
    - Does not use the team from a kill event if it's empty, instead relies on team from previous events - TK plugin works again!
- Made !iamgod work automatically when there are no superadmins in the database, can be completely disabled by adding <set name="iamgod">none</set> to plugin_admin.xml
- Fixed: getWarning errors had the text "getSpam" instead of "getWarning"
- Added a replay log mode. Simply set the config to an old game log and server.replay to on in b3.xml. Only works for COD4 log files. Used to debug b3.
- Fixed clients.py to save the last used ip. Fixes empty ip fields in clientrecords and the countryfilter plugin to work properly.

- Added WoP parser (World of Padman)
